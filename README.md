# Brackets-LinqSharp

Brackets-LinqSharp is an extension for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) editor - with the help of OmniSharp for brackets, you can 
compose C# programs with intellisense - but unfortunately you cannot run them! That's where this extension comes in to the picture.
With this extension a new menu called "Run" is created, which has just one item for now - "Open File in LinqPad". If you have LinqPad
interested, the current file will be opened in LinqPad as a C# program!

Obviously, this would work even if you don't have OmniSharp, but you have a C# program. This is a work-in-progress. So this will
be changing for a while now!

To use this, just download the extension, extrack in to the "extensions" folder of brackets (`Help -> Show Extensions Folder`)
